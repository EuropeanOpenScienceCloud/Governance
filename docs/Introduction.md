Introduction
============

The EOSCpilot project objectives are to:

-   design and propose a possible governance framework for the EOSC and
    contribute to the development of European open science policy and
    best practice;

-   develop a number of pilots that integrate services and
    infrastructures to demonstrate interoperability in a number of
    scientific domains; and

-   engage with a broad range of stakeholders, crossing borders and
    communities, to build the trust and skills required for adoption of
    an open approach to scientific research

The objective of Work-package 2 is to design and trial a stakeholder
driven governance framework with the involvement of research
communities, research institutions, research infrastructures including
e-infrastructures, and research funding bodies, to shape and oversee
future development of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), and to
identify appropriate federated governance model(s) and decision-making
structure for it (see Figure 2).

outlines an framework for a stakeholder driven governance and
decision-making structure which could be used after the initial
implementation phase of the EOSC.

The framework outlines:

-   A three-layer governance model consisting of Strategic, Executive
    and Stakeholder layers, and the interactions and decision flow
    between these layers

-   A resource model for the EOSC, and a skeleton outline of the
    Executive layer's role in commissioning and supporting the EOSC
    resources

-   An outline of the role and structure of the Stakeholder layer and
    its interaction with the Executive

EOSC Governance Stakeholder Roles
--------------------------

The framework concentrates on three stakeholder roles, understanding that different stakeholders can play multiple roles, or different roles are different points in the research lifecycle or within their organisation.

| Primary Role| Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Provider** | Provides services, data or other resources (e.g. scientific instruments, training) into EOSC |
| **Consumer** | Will make use of services, data, or other resources from EOSC |
| **Decision-makers** | Will be involved in the strategic direction, compliance and funding of EOSC |

In addition, there are some additional roles which are covered by the above stakeholders, but worth explicitly articulating.

| Supplementary Role | Description | Relationship to Primary Roles |
|--------------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| **Consumer-Provider** | Many stakeholders (including e-infrastructures, research infrastructures, VREs etc.) will consume services from some providers to provide value added services to other consumers. | Member of both Provider and Consumer roles |
| **Funder** | Provides funding for research on a local, national or international level | Sub-role within Decision-makers |
| **Policy-makers** | Regulates policy at a local, national or regional level.	Sub-role within Decision-makers |

Governance Principles
=====================

*"Those groups who can affect or are affected by the achievements of an
organization\'s purpose should be given the opportunity to comment and
input into the development of decisions that affect them"*[^1]

*Stakeholder Engagement: A Road Map to Meaningful Engagement --
Cranfield School of Management*

A key requirement in the strategic requirements listed in Section 2 is
the need for the EOSC to be stakeholder driven. It should be "a
multi-level and multi-stakeholder governance that ensures a
representation for the main stakeholder categories and disciplines,
integrating both the national and European levels of authority." (OSPP
Recommendations -- Section 2.3). It is therefore important for all
stakeholders and all stakeholder roles to be able to participate in the
governance.

Moreover, to be "open to all players, public and private, European and
non-European" (HLEG Recommendations -- Section 2.2), and following the
analogies between the development of EOSC and the development of the
Internet suggested in the HLEG report, it is also a requirement that:

*No one person, organisation, or company governs the digital space* \...
Solutions to issues in each layer include policies, best practices,
standards, specifications, and tools developed by the collaboration of
stakeholders and experts from actors in business, governments, academia,
technical, and civil society.[^2]

This is encapsulated in discussing the EOSC as a "Commons" -- a
management theory for natural resources that groups of people
(communities, user groups) manage for individual and collective benefit,
which through the work of Fuster Morell amongst others have been
extended to Digital and Knowledge Commons[^3]:

The **digital commons** are defined as *"an information and knowledge
resources that are collectively created and owned or shared between or
among a community and that tend to be non-exclusive, that is, be
(generally freely) available to third parties. Thus, they are oriented
to favor use and reuse, rather than to exchange as a commodity.
Additionally, the community of people building them can intervene in the
governing of their interaction processes and of their shared
resources."*[^4]

This has led to various proposals to apply the commons principles[^5] to
research e-infrastructures and open science. The e-Infrastructure
Reflection Group proposed an e-Infrastructure Commons in a 2013 white
paper[^6], which proposes the need for:

**Community building, high-level strategy and coordination in Europe:**
for each type of e-Infrastructure service, a single coordinating
organisation with a central role for user communities. These bodies, in
turn, will need a forum for coordination between them across the
different e-Infrastructure types.

This would require strong stakeholder engagement to strengthen
governance on the following levels:

-   On the **strategic** level user communities should organise
    themselves to drive the long-term strategy.

-   On the **service provision** level user communities will have to
    learn to use their joint purchasing power, in a competitive market,
    which includes both public and commercial offerings.

-   On the **innovation** level, advanced users of international
    e-Infrastructures should participate in the specification and
    real-life testing of new e-Infrastructure developments.

-   On the **standardisation** level user communities should contribute
    to the process of setting and implementing the international
    standards necessary to achieve the international, service-oriented,
    interoperable e-Infrastructure portfolio envisioned for the
    e-Infrastructure Commons 2020.

EGI and other e-infrastructures built upon the e-IRG e-Infrastructure
Commons recommendations, extending them to Open Science in general, in a
set of white papers and proposals on an Open Science Commons[^7]. These
map key principles of Commons management to Open Science[^8]:

Table 2 - Principles of Open Science Commons[^9]

Both these initiatives can be considered prototypes of the EOSC vision
and ambition. The key governance principles, particularly those
concerning the involvement of all stakeholders as peers in the
decision-making process, are still extremely pertinent. Key principles
of Commons which underpin these white papers and which should be
observed by any EOSC Governance model can be summarised from Eleanor
Ostrom's book "Governing the Commons"[^10]:

1.  Group boundaries are clearly defined.

2.  Rules governing the use of collective goods are well matched to
    local needs and conditions.

3.  Most individuals affected by these rules can participate in
    modifying the rules.

4.  The rights of community members to devise their own rules is
    respected by external authorities.

5.  A system for monitoring member\'s behaviour exists; the community
    members themselves undertake this monitoring.

6.  A graduated system of sanctions is used.

7.  Community members have access to low-cost conflict resolution
    mechanisms.

8.  Appropriation, provision, monitoring, enforcement, conflict
    resolution, and governance activities are organized in multiple
    layers of nested enterprises.

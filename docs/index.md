<td>Abstract</td>
<td><p>This document outlines an initial draft framework for a stakeholder driven governance and decision-making structure. This will form the basis, of a governance piloting exercise whereby the framework will be co-designed and developed with the community using the draft framework outlined here as a foundation and strawman.</p>
<p>The draft framework outlines: a three-layer governance model consisting of Strategic, Executive and Stakeholder layers, and the interactions and decision flow between these layers; a Stakeholder and Resource model for the EOSC, and a structure for the Executive and Stakeholder layers.</p></td>

Legal Structures

Executive
---------

There are broadly three potential models for the EOSC to commission and
provide financial support to Core and Supported EOSC Resources. Earlier
models can be regarded as intermediate steps towards later model as well
as potential final models.

### Lightweight Delivery Model

Executive commissions and pays for (either directly or through some
compensatory mechanism) Core and Supported resources from international,
national, institutional and commercial providers through existing
mechanisms (e.g. Framework Programme instruments such as Virtual Access)

ERIC) who would have responsibility for commissioning (e.g. contracting
or framework agreements) Core and Supported Resources.

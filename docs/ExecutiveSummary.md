Executive Summary
=================

The objective of Work-package 2 is to design and trial a stakeholder
driven governance framework with the involvement of research
communities, research institutions, research infrastructures including
e-infrastructures, and research funding bodies, to shape and oversee
future development of the European Open Science Cloud, and to identify
appropriate federated governance model(s) and decision-making structure
for it.

As part of that objective, this document outlines a framework for a
stakeholder driven governance and decision-making structure for an
established EOSC (i.e. post 2021), following from the implementation
phase governance structure as detailed in the European Commission’s
staff working document **"Implementation Roadmap for the European Open
Science Cloud"**[^1]. This document also outlines the key differences to
be addressed in moving from the implementation phase governance to this
framework, and the reasons behind these.

framework outlines:

-   A three-layer governance model consisting of Strategic, Executive
    and Stakeholder layers, and the interactions and decision flow
    between these layers

-   A resource model for the EOSC, and a skeleton outline of the
    Executive layer’s role in commissioning and supporting the EOSC
    resources

-   An outline of the role and structure of the Stakeholder layer and
    its interaction with the Executive.

Summary and Conclusions
=======================

This document outlines a stakeholder driven governance framework for the
long-term management and oversight of EOSC. It forms a natural evolution
of the implementation phase governance structure established by the
European Commission by:

1.  Extending the Executive to include standing groups performing
    important roles in terms of Legal (including policy), Organisational
    (including funding), Semantic (in terms of operational management),
    and Technical interoperability (as defined by the European
    Interoperability Framework) of EOSC resources

2.  Establishing a shadow structure to the Executive within the
    Stakeholder forum, to ensure that the Executive delivers an EOSC fit
    for its end users, and to develop metrics and policies which meet
    user requirements and demands

3.  Moving time-based working groups from the Executive to the
    Stakeholder forum as the focus of these working groups change from
    initial implementation issues to focus on the longer term future
    development and evolution of EOSC

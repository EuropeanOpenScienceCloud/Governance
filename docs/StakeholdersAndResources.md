Stakeholders and Resources
==========================

Stakeholders
------------

Through the EOSCPilot Engagement activities, we have established a range
of different stakeholder who would participate in and would both benefit
from and provide benefits to the EOSC. Any effective governance
structure would need to involve and take input from all these
stakeholders. The key classes of stakeholder identified with the
community is outlined in Table 2.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><img src="StakeholdersAndResources/media/image1.png" style="width:0.3937in;height:0.3937in" /> Researchers</th>
<th>The European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) will offer Europe's researchers and science and technology professionals a virtual environment to store, share and reuse the large volumes of information generated by the big data revolution. EOSC, as a functional embodiment of the European Cloud Initiative, will support data-driven innovation and contribute to the creation of a Digital Single Market in Europe. Science and industry will obviously benefit from these developments.</th>

<td><p><strong>The notion of Research Infrastructures refers both to traditional large physical installations, as well as to distributed facilities which “include networked resources and skill / capacity building initiatives. These resources use advances in information and communications technology and the big data revolution to underpin new collaborative methods of research”.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Research infrastructures may be based at a single location, distributed across several sites and organisations, or provided via online platforms. Europe hosts several large-scale research infrastructures operating across national boundaries.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Research Infrastructures are the base on which the future federated EOSC will be built. They provide several types of services to the EOSC, including data services and expertise. Research infrastructures are often very experienced in providing cloud services to researchers, and as such, are key players in the specification and the set-up of the EOSC. Close cooperation with other research infrastructures and e-Infrastructures within the EOSC will increase the capability of research infrastructures to combine and integrate data and resources in a common environment.</strong></p></td>

<p>The EC Digital Single Market refers to E-Infrastructures as ways of addressing needs of European researchers for digital services in terms of networking, computing and data management. They foster the emergence of Open Science and support the circulation of knowledge in Europe online and therefore constitute an essential building block for the European Research Area.</p>
<p>A Virtual Research Environment (VRE) is a community of practice, an organisation and a bundle of services which supports researchers by providing access to shared documents tools and resources they need during a research project. Some examples of VREs are EVER-EST, a VRE for research on Earth-science, and VRE4EIC, supporting a multi-disciplinary approach to research on climate change and energy sustainability.</p></td>

<p><strong>Several bodies at the European level make research grants available to researchers regardless of their nationality or field of research. This includes programmes supported by the EU under the Research and Innovation Framework programmes – including for example the direct actions of the Joint Research Centre, or the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions or the actions managed by the European Research Council. Other European funding programmes are managed by the European Science Foundation, the European University Institute, the European Association of National Metrology Institutes (EURAMET), etc.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Many European countries have one or more national agencies responsible for research, science and/or technology development. The policies and mandates of these agencies will inevitably be different from country to country, but they are essential drivers of Open Science and it is vital for the EOSC to engage in a common platform with these stakeholders.</strong></p></td>

Table 3 - EOSC Stakeholders

The framework concentrates on three stakeholder *roles*, understanding
that different stakeholders can play multiple roles, or different roles
are different points in the research lifecycle or within their
organisation. These are outlined in Table 3 (the stakeholders listed are
indicative and not meant to be exhaustive or exclusive).

In addition, there are some additional roles which are covered by the
above stakeholders, but worth explicitly articulating – these are in
Table 4.

Resources
---------

### Resources

**EOSC Resource = Services + Data + People**

At the centre of this model are the EOSC Resources themselves – the EOSC
Resources cover the range of services and facilities needed to support
Open Science and Research. These include technical services such as
analytics and computational services, cloud services, thematic services
tuned to particular research disciplines, e-infrastructure and
middleware services such as access identity management; but also
knowledge resources such as datasets, storage, digital library and
archives; access services such as a service catalogue and portals;
scientific instruments and facilities; and facilitation activities such
as training, software development support and consultancy.

### Compliance and Compatibility

It is envisaged that most of the EOSC resources will be fully
*compliant* with the Principles of Engagement and compatible with the
technical architecture. However, it is likely that, at least initially,
there will be resources which are not fully *compliant* but are merely
technically *compatible* with the EOSC but are still of value to the
EOSC Consumers. Such resources might meet the needs of specific
disciplines only, or may be currently in the process of becoming
compliant.

There may also be some resources which may not be fully technically
*compatible* with EOSC resources nor fully *compliant* with the
Principles of Engagement, but which nevertheless outside are of value to
EOSC consumers. These would still be usable by EOSC consumers as
recommended by the HLEG that “It should be clear that non-EOSC approved
players are free to explore any role in the Open Science ecosystem they
wish, even if they do not adhere to the Principles of Engagement. They
will just not be able to brand their services as EOSC
approved/certified”.

This is illustrated below. The EOSCPilot has co-developed Rules of
Participation with the community, as well as developed a technical
architecture which provide more precise definitions of *compliant* and
*compatible*.

Figure 8 - EOSC Resource Model: Rules of Participation

###  [section]

### Core Resources

To function, there will need to be some **Core Resources** underpinning
the EOSC analogous to services the internet such as domain naming
services etc.. Such resources might include the EOSC service catalogue,
access and identity management, etc. The need for **Core Resources** was
also identified by the OSPP EOSC Working Group (see Section 2.3) whose
definition is “set of services and processes that are needed to
integrate and enable access to the various resources federated in the
EOSC”. The **Core Resources** will need to be directly commissioned and
financially compensated. The **Executive** should have the primary
responsibility, in discussion with the **Strategic** and **Stakeholder**
layers, to determine the requirements of these core resources, and
decide how they will be delivered.

### Compensation

In order to meet the objective of “free at the point of use”, resource
provision will need to be compensated by other means. The EOSCPilot is
currently working on Business and Funding Models on how this
compensation would work, but various models could include contribution
of resources by member states and institutions, direct commission by the
**Executive** or compensation based on usage using mechanism in the
Framework Programmes (such as Transnational or Virtual Access
instruments[^1]) or new mechanisms such as “Cloud Coins” or other credit
mechanisms. Facilities and services to enable such credit mechanisms
will need to be provided by the EOSC **Core** **Resources**.

### Service Gaps 

To ensure that the EOSC remains relevant and to encourage innovation, it
will be necessary to identify any gaps there may be in provision. Gaps
may be identified by **Stakeholder** or **Executive** layer and notified
to the Executive and Strategic layers. The **Executive** will need to
develop mechanisms to fill any such gaps in provision, either by
directly incentivising the development of new services or through
advocacy to the Strategic layer and the Framework Programmes.

### Open Market

To ensure that EOSC remains “open to all players, public and private,
European and non-European” (Section 2.2), there may also be resources
within EOSC which will not be directly compensated through EOSC, but
through other means (including commercial resources paid directly by
researchers or their institutions), but which nevertheless meet the
requirements to be EOSC *compliant* or *compatible* and are of value to
the community.

In summary:

-   An EOSC Resource is *Compliant* if it meets the Principles of
    Engagement and the technical requirements as defined by the EOSC
    technical architecture

-   An EOSC Resource is *Compatible* if it meets the technical
    requirements as defined by the EOSC technical architecture

-   Some resources which are needed to integrate and enable access to
    the various resources federated in the EOSC will be *Core Resources*
    (which by definition will need to be *Compliant*)

-   *Compliant* resources will be eligible to be part of EOSC; resources
    neither *Compliant* nor *Compatible* will be external to EOSC;
    *Compatible* only resources might be borderline (if, for instance,
    they are transitioning into EOSC)

-   EOSC resources (both commercial and non-commercial) might be
    compensated for their usage via mechanisms within EOSC; some EOSC
    resources might be funded via other means, including commercial
    models

Resource Delivery Models
------------------------

There are broadly three potential models for the EOSC to commission and
provide financial support to Core and Supported EOSC Resources. Earlier
models can be regarded as intermediate steps towards later model as well
as potential final models.

### Lightweight Delivery Model

Executive commissions and pays for (either directly or through some
compensatory mechanism) Core and Supported services from international,
national, institutional and commercial providers through existing
mechanisms (e.g. Framework Programme instruments such as Virtual Access)

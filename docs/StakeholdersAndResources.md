StakeholderS and Resources
==========================

Stakeholders
------------

Through the EOSCPilot Engagement activities, we have established a range
of different stakeholder who would participate in and would both benefit
from and provide benefits to the EOSC. Any effective governance
structure would need to involve and take input from all these
stakeholders. The key classes of stakeholder identified with the
community is outlined in Table 2.

Table 3 - EOSC Stakeholders

The framework concentrates on three stakeholder *roles*, understanding
that different stakeholders can play multiple roles, or different roles
are different points in the research lifecycle or within their
organisation. These are outlined in Table 3 (the stakeholders listed are
indicative and not meant to be exhaustive or exclusive).

Table 5 - EOSC Supplementary Stakeholder Roles

Resources
---------

### Resources

**EOSC Resource = Services + Data + People**

At the centre of this model are the EOSC Resources themselves -- the
EOSC Resources cover the range of services and facilities needed to
support Open Science and Research. These include technical services such
as analytics and computational services, cloud services, thematic
services tuned to particular research disciplines, e-infrastructure and
middleware services such as access identity management; but also
knowledge resources such as datasets, storage, digital library and
archives; access services such as a service catalogue and portals;
scientific instruments and facilities; and facilitation activities such
as training, software development support and consultancy.

### Compliance and Compatibility

It is envisaged that most of the EOSC resources will be fully
*compliant* with the Principles of Engagement and compatible with the
technical architecture. However, it is likely that, at least initially,
there will be resources which are not fully *compliant* but are merely
technically *compatible* with the EOSC but are still of value to the
EOSC Consumers. Such resources might meet the needs of specific
disciplines only, or may be currently in the process of becoming
compliant.

There may also be some resources which may not be fully technically
*compatible* with EOSC resources nor fully *compliant* with the
Principles of Engagement, but which nevertheless outside are of value to
EOSC consumers. These would still be usable by EOSC consumers as
recommended by the HLEG that "It should be clear that non-EOSC approved
players are free to explore any role in the Open Science ecosystem they
wish, even if they do not adhere to the Principles of Engagement. They
will just not be able to brand their services as EOSC
approved/certified".

This is illustrated below. The EOSCPilot has co-developed Rules of
Participation with the community, as well as developed a technical
architecture which provide more precise definitions of *compliant* and
*compatible*.

![EOSC Resource Model - Rules of
Participation](./StakeholdersAndResources/media/image11.png){width="5.833333333333333in"
height="2.4425010936132985in"}

Figure 8 - EOSC Resource Model: Rules of Participation

###  {#section .ListParagraph}

### Core Resources

To function, there will need to be some **Core Resources** underpinning
the EOSC analogous to the Logical Layer in the Digital Governance for
the Internet (**Error! Reference source not found.**). Such resources
might include the EOSC service catalogue, access and identity
management, etc. The need for **Core Resources** was also identified by
the OSPP EOSC Working Group (see Section 2.3) whose definition is "set
of services and processes that are needed to integrate and enable access
to the various resources federated in the EOSC". The **Core Resources**
will need to be directly commissioned and financially compensated. The
**Executive** should have the primary responsibility, in discussion with
the **Strategic** and **Stakeholder** layers, to determine the
requirements of these core resources, and decide how they will be
delivered.

### Compensation

In order to meet the objective of "free at the point of use", resource
provision will need to be compensated by other means. The EOSCPilot is
currently working on Business and Funding Models on how this
compensation would work, but various models could include contribution
of resources by member states and institutions, direct commission by the
**Executive** or compensation based on usage using mechanism in the
Framework Programmes (such as Transnational or Virtual Access
instruments[^1]) or new mechanisms such as "Cloud Coins" or other credit
mechanisms. Facilities and services to enable such credit mechanisms
will need to be provided by the EOSC **Core** **Resources**.

### Service Gaps 

To ensure that the EOSC remains relevant and to encourage innovation, it
will be necessary to identify any gaps there may be in provision. Gaps
may be identified by **Stakeholder** or **Executive** layer and notified
to the Executive and Strategic layers. The **Executive** will need to
develop mechanisms to fill any such gaps in provision, either by
directly incentivising the development of new services or through
advocacy to the Strategic layer and the Framework Programmes.

### Open Market

To ensure that EOSC remains "open to all players, public and private,
European and non-European" (Section 2.2), there may also be resources
within EOSC which will not be directly compensated through EOSC, but
through other means (including commercial resources paid directly by
researchers or their institutions), but which nevertheless meet the
requirements to be EOSC *compliant* or *compatible* and are of value to
the community.

In summary (see also **Error! Reference source not found.**):

-   An EOSC Resource is *Compliant* if it meets the Principles of
    Engagement and the technical requirements as defined by the EOSC
    technical architecture

-   An EOSC Resource is *Compatible* if it meets the technical
    requirements as defined by the EOSC technical architecture

-   Some resources which are needed to integrate and enable access to
    the various resources federated in the EOSC will be *Core Resources*
    (which by definition will need to be *Compliant*)

-   *Compliant* resources will be eligible to be part of EOSC; resources
    neither *Compliant* nor *Compatible* will be external to EOSC;
    *Compatible* only resources might be borderline (if, for instance,
    they are transitioning into EOSC)

-   EOSC resources (both commercial and non-commercial) might be
    compensated for their usage via mechanisms within EOSC; some EOSC
    resources might be funded via other means, including commercial
    models

Figure 9 - EOSC Resource Model: Economics

Resource Delivery Models
------------------------

There are broadly three potential models for the EOSC to commission and
provide financial support to Core and Supported EOSC Resources. Earlier
models can be regarded as intermediate steps towards later model as well
as potential final models.

### Lightweight Delivery Model

Executive commissions and pays for (either directly or through some
compensatory mechanism) Core and Supported services from international,
national, institutional and commercial providers through existing
mechanisms (e.g. Framework Programme instruments such as Virtual Access)
